#+title: Roadmap

* Issues

** DONE Map position is not reliable
it seems that the very first time the app is started and permissions allowed, the
position (last or current) is fetched instantly. But the next time the app is started fetching location is abnormally long

-> fixed by removing geolocator getCurrentPostion
waiting for geolocator currentpostion seems to be broken at least on some devices for unknown reasons.
rely only on geolocator lastknownposition + position stream as a workaround


** DONE Map position seems to be still unreliable
the map correctly fetches the last position. yet it seems that it's not updated.
if another gps app is opened (such as OSMAnd) which refresh device gps position, then bhikersclub app position gets updated...
this maybe consistent with In the meantime, geolocator low locationaccuracy

-> fix is: add a double tap behavior on mylocation button to force refresh with high accuracy
