## 📌 About
**Bhikers club** is a free and privacy-focused Android & iOS mobile app for cyclists and hikers, based on OpenStreetMap data and services. It helps you locate essential spots while on the road, whether you need a **restaurant**, a **bakery**, a **hotel**,  a **camping site**, a **shelter**, or a **water fountain**. 

🚴‍♀️ **One of our goal is to map more bhikers-friendly places!** Users can contribute by tagging Points of Interest (POIs) in **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** with the [bike_friend]https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/bike_friend#overview) special tag, making the cycling community stronger and more informed.
