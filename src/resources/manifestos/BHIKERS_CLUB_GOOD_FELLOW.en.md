# The Bhikers Club Good Fellow 

Welcome to the Bhikers Club! As a member of this community, we embrace the spirit of camaraderie, adventure, and respect for all. Our "Good Fellow" Membership Convention serves as a set of guidelines to ensure that every cyclist upholds the values of kindness, responsibility, and mindfulness on the road.

## 1. Respect for Nature
A Bhikers Club good fellow will always:

- **Leave no trace**: Always dispose of waste responsibly and avoid littering. Carry trash bags or use available recycling bins.
- **Stay on marked paths**: Stick to designated bike lanes, trails, and roads. Avoid damaging flora by sticking to well-established routes.
- **Protect little animals**: Avoid harming or running over small creatures such as snails, insects, and other wildlife. Slow down and be aware of your surroundings to prevent accidents and ensure that you share the road with all living beings.
- **Promote sustainability**: Support eco-friendly initiatives, including the use of sustainable cycling gear and advocating for clean energy solutions.

## 2. Respect for Pedestrians
A Bhikers Club good fellow will always:

- **Yield to pedestrians**: Always give way to pedestrians when necessary, especially in areas where foot traffic is heavy, like parks or shopping areas.
- **Use bells or horns responsibly**: Notify pedestrians of your presence gently and respectfully, ensuring they have enough time to move aside if necessary.
- **Maintain a safe speed**: Always cycle at a safe, controlled speed, especially when near pedestrians or in busy areas. Never put anyone at risk with reckless or high-speed cycling.

## 3. Promote Equality and Feminism
A Bhikers Club good fellow will always:

- **Respect women**: Treat all women with dignity and respect, both on and off the bike. Ensure that women feel safe and valued in all cycling spaces.
- **Challenge sexism**: Stand against any form of sexist behavior, discrimination, or harassment. Promote positive, respectful interactions and ensure that women‚Äôs voices and experiences are heard and valued in all aspects of cycling.
