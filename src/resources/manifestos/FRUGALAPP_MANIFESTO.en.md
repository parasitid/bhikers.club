# Frugal App Manifesto

## Preamble

In an age of ever-growing software complexity, increasing hardware requirements, and privacy-invading practices, we advocate for a more sustainable, ethical, and user-centric approach to software development. We call this the **Frugal App** approach.

A **Frugal App** is designed with efficiency, sustainability, and respect for users as core principles. It avoids unnecessary dependencies, minimizes resource consumption, and remains accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their hardware capabilities.

## Core Principles

### 1. Open Source by Default
A Frugal App must be **open source**, allowing transparency, collaboration, and community-driven improvements. This ensures longevity, security, and trust in the software.

### 2. Minimal Resource Consumption
A Frugal App should strive to **preserve device resources** by being lightweight and optimized for performance. It should:
- Use minimal CPU, RAM, and storage.
- Avoid unnecessary background processes.
- Favor efficiency over bloat.

### 3. No Mandatory Dedicated Infrastructure
A Frugal App should be **self-sufficient** and not rely on centralized, proprietary infrastructure. Where connectivity is required, it should:
- Work offline whenever possible.
- Avoid requiring accounts or cloud-based services.
- Prefer peer-to-peer or self-hosted alternatives.

### 4. Respect User Privacy
A Frugal App must **respect user privacy** by design. This means:
- No telemetry, tracking, or unnecessary data collection.
- No third-party analytics or invasive permissions.
- Transparency about any data processing.

### 5. Minimal and Justifiable Permissions
A Frugal App should **only request the permissions it truly needs** to function. This includes:
- Clearly stating why each permission is required.
- Avoiding access to sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.
- Providing users with options to limit permissions.

### 6. Long-Term Maintainability
A Frugal App should be **built to last** by prioritizing:
- Simplicity in code and architecture.
- Backward compatibility where feasible.
- Avoidance of dependency bloat and vendor lock-in.

### 7. Device and Accessibility Friendly
A Frugal App should **run on a wide range of devices**, supporting older hardware and alternative operating systems. It should also:
- Prioritize accessibility for diverse users.
- Avoid requiring high-end specifications.
- Offer adaptable UI/UX for various devices.
- Support older versions of platforms like Android and iOS where feasible, ensuring longevity and accessibility for users with legacy devices.

### 8. Essential Features Only
A Frugal App should **only include features that bring real value** to users. This means:
- Avoiding feature bloat and unnecessary complexity.
- Prioritizing core functionality over flashy, redundant extras.
- Ensuring each feature is meaningful, well-implemented, and resource-efficient.

### 9. User Control and Freedom
A Frugal App should **empower users**, not control them. This means:
- Allowing full customization and configurability.
- Providing offline capabilities where feasible.
- Avoiding DRM, forced updates, or artificial limitations.

## Conclusion
We believe that software should serve users, not the other way around. By adhering to these principles, we can build applications that are efficient, ethical, and accessible to everyone.
